# 💬 Real-Time Chat Application

## 📘 Project Description

The **Real-Time Chat Application** is a fully responsive and modern messaging interface built using pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates the core functionalities of popular chat platforms such as Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp Web, providing a sleek, user-friendly experience that mimics real-time communication through dynamic updates and status changes.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

The goal of this application was to build a web-based chat interface that demonstrates **real-time messaging behavior**, **interactive user experience**, and **responsive design**. Following the Task-2 guidelines, the app simulates WebSocket-like messaging, user activity status, chat room switching, and message rendering using fundamental front-end technologies.
